    FindWords should return the number of all non-distinct occurrences 
    of the words found in the array, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, 
    and also the reverse in each direction. 
    The input to FindWords is a rectangular matrix of characters 
    (list of list of char).
    
    We are trying to see the quality of the code you write (hint: unit tests).  
    Donâ€™t worry too much about performance and efficiency 
    but you program should work correctly. 
    It should also be capable of scaling to puzzles 
    with dimensions such as 4x4, 6x9, 9x9.
